Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up the Project from Google Drive
Share the Project from Google Drive

Ensure your project files are uploaded to Google Drive (ZIP the project files if they're too large to upload individually).
Right-click the uploaded file and select Get link.
Make sure the link is set to Anyone with the link can view (or anyone can download).
Download the Project from Google Drive

Open the link: Google Drive Link.(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jgC-n4excocHYa__3U679f3-S65zS-4c/view?usp=drive_link)
Click the Download button on the top-right corner of the page to download the project ZIP file to your local system.
Extract the ZIP File

Once the ZIP file is downloaded, extract it to your desired location on your laptop.
Install a Text Editor

If you haven't already, install a code editor like VS Code from here.
Open the Project in Your Code Editor

Open VS Code (or your preferred text editor).
Click File > Open Folder and select the folder where you extracted the project.
View the Project in a Browser

Open the index.html file from the extracted folder in your browser to preview the website.
Alternatively, you can use Live Server in VS Code to run the project locally for live reloading.
Start Modifying the Files

You can now begin editing the project files in your text editor:
index.html: Website structure (HTML).
styles.css: Website styling (CSS).
script.js: Functionality and animations (JavaScript).
Test Changes Locally

Refresh the browser after any changes or use Live Server for automatic updates in real-time.
Upload Changes Back to Google Drive (Optional)

After making changes, you can compress your updated project into a ZIP file and upload it back to Google Drive if you want to share it with others or keep a backup.
Thatâ€™s all! You can now work on your Workout Help Website project by downloading it from Google Drive and editing it locally on your laptop. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸš€
